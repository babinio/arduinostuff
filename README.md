Our life has changed since a pet, named Luna, came to our house. Luna is a living organism and it has many different needs as humans. But, if the dog is most of the time in the house, things may become more complicated. We found that a diaper is a good solution and from the first month we started train the dog to go on the diaper to do nasty stuff. After that, we put the diaper in the toilet. Since then and with some training, Luna goes to the toilet when we are nearby. When we are not, Louna goes to the back of the dining room. In this case, negative behavioral methods may have had some effect, but we prefer not to use something like that.

As an electronics engineer I thought a nice idea would be to create a small alarm with an arduino board and try that out. The idea is simple, when Luna goes behind the table a tone from arduino  will be produced in order to scare luna away. After some work and google search the arduino alarm system for Luna works fine and then i had to put it to the place, where the dog does to do nasty things. In the future I will come back and inform you if the results was positive.
